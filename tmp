Set throttle settings
assuming input range is 3900
set adc1_min 400
set adc1_max 2000
turn knob to see input

Run in open loop 
set curr_max 40 (something safe)
set SL_sensor OL
set input_opt 8 (UART)
change ol_step (steps per pulse) from 0 to some number for stopping and starting 
set ol_step 20 

Run in open loop at fixed amperage:
set curr_max 20 (something safe)
set SL_sensor OL
set input_opt 8 (UART)
change ol_step (steps per pulse) from 0 to some number for stopping and starting 
set ol_step 20 

set the sensorless startup option
set SL_sensor 1
spin up the motor
let it freewheel down
It finds the hall sensor position whenever it is freewheeling
